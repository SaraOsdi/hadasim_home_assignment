This program is written in Java using and presents the user with a menu that includes two options:

Calculate area/scope of a rectangular tower

Calculate perimeter or print an isosceles triangle

As long as the user does not choose to exit the program by selecting option 3, the program will continue to offer these two options.

Rectangular Tower
When the user selects the first option, they will be prompted to input the height and width of the tower.

The program will check whether the tower is a square or a rectangle with the difference between the lengths of its sides.

If the difference is greater than 5, the area of the tower will be printed. Otherwise, the scope of the tower will be printed.

Isosceles Triangle
When the user selects the second option, they will be prompted to choose between two sub-options:

Calculation of the perimeter of the triangle: The perimeter of the triangle will be calculated and the answer will be printed to the user.

Printing the triangle: The program will check if the width of the triangle is an even number or if its width is longer than 2 times its height.

If so, the program will print a message to the user that the triangle cannot be printed.

If the width is odd and shorter than twice its height, the program will print the triangle in the required format.


Instructions:

Download Main.java and run it in your favorite IDE.

Clarification - for an input of 4 for height and 3 for width,
for example,
the expected output will be:

and  not:

The first line does not participate in the division,
as reflected in the provided examples.
For a height of 12 and a width of 9, 
the expected output is:

as it might be if the first line indeed participant in the division.
